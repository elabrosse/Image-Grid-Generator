- Use a module bundler like webpack (The npm build tasks are only Linux or UNIX-like compatible atm)
- Use react components
- Evenly distribute pixels
- Extract logic for cell size calculation to ts as a standalone module
- Persist GUI state to local storage
- Images are saved as PNG, but if the input is JPG, the extracted file is JPG content wrapped in a PNG extension. some image viewers have a problem with that
- Fetch base64 image from imagemagick, not file (hopefully mitigates O.S. file handle limit)
- Responsive scaling of the generated images should be straightforward a canvas instead of img HTML element
- Preview canvas with grid on top
- UX: some progression indicator
- Handle imagemagick errors and bubble up to the UI
